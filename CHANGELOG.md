# Changelog

Notable changes to sparkinfer. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versions track the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer/releases).

## [Unreleased] — Batched prompt ingestion

### Added

- **Batched prefill** (#148) — prompt ingestion carried one token at a time through 93
  layers. The layer loop now sits outside the token loop, so a chunk of tokens goes
  through each kernel together and a weight tile is read once for the chunk instead of
  once per token. Measured same-binary against its own per-token walk at **98.80 tok/s at
  32k**, output bit-identical at every chunk width. The pinned frontier stays at **69.02**,
  the last value an eval round measured — 98.80 is real but unsealed, and the tier basis
  does not move on a number the log cannot show you.

### Fixed

- **The mix took its two strides in the wrong order** (#148) — `attn_res_mix_f32` is
  `(n_rows, act_row_stride, bank_row_stride, …)` and all three call sites passed
  `(n_rows, bank_row, H)`, so activations were read at the bank's pitch and banks at the
  activation's. It is invisible until the model is deep enough to bank twice: `bank_row`
  is `res_bank_row_elems * max_ckpt`, `max_ckpt` is `ceil(n_layers / 12)`, so at ≤12
  layers the two are equal and each wrong argument lands on the right value. `n_rows == 1`
  never reads either, so decode and the per-token loop were always exact — the chunk
  driver is the first caller to pass more than one row. Bisected on the 4-token probe:
  bit-identical through 12 layers, KLD 1.64 at 14, 3.47 at 93.
- **A gate documented default-off was read opt-out** (#148) —
  `SPARKINFER_K3_KDA_QKVG_BATCH` says `DEFAULT OFF` in its own comment and again in
  `kimi_k3_attn_batch_ok`, but `!(e && e[0] == '0')` made unset mean ON. Its sibling
  `k3_kda_pre_batch_enabled()` eight lines below already had the opt-in form. With it on,
  every chunk ≥ 2 tokens died with `LAUNCH FAILED at layer 0, phase Attn`.

### Note on a retracted number

#148 first measured **169.72 tok/s** and was rejected on accuracy. That number was
produced with both defects above live, and the corrupted walk was *faster* because it was
reading the wrong rows — the failure mode this codebase warns about repeatedly. **98.80**
is what the same change does once it computes the right answer.

## [Unreleased] — CI retargeted for the H200×8 setup

The seven workflows inherited from sparkinfer were SN74 competition governance for an
RTX 5090 Qwen frontier. They provided **zero coverage of the K3 harness** — `eval-policy`
linted four hand-listed Qwen-era files — while actively obstructing the work this repo
exists to do. Replaced with CI built around one honest limit: no hosted runner will ever
run an 802 GiB model, so gate what is cheap here and expensive on a rented node.

### Added

- **`ci.yml`** — five jobs, all runnable locally:
  - `shell` — `bash -n` over **every** tracked script (not a hand list) + a CRLF guard
  - `python` — `py_compile` over every tracked file + every **discovered** `test_*.py`
  - `configs` — YAML parses, derived arch arithmetic is self-consistent (layer split, MLA
    key length, KV bytes/token, KDA state bytes recomputed from the reference formulas),
    relative links resolve
  - `plans` — `--dry-run` resolves for all three nodes; the fork pin does not leak into the
    upstream harness
  - `lock` — **every pinned baseline traces to a committed measurement**
- **`bench/scripts/check_reference_lock.py`** — the enforcement behind the `lock` job. `0`
  means not measured and is always allowed; any non-zero baseline must match a recorded
  sweep for the same node *and* context (prefill and decode are not interchangeable). This
  is what makes the repo's central claim unfakeable rather than merely stated.
- **`bench/scripts/audit_baseline_pins.py`** + **`pin-audit.yml`** — weekly drift watch on
  the two external things the baseline depends on and cannot control: PR #48 can be
  force-pushed, and a quant can be re-uploaded with a different shard count. Verified live
  against both APIs. Opens/updates an issue on drift; fails the check on a PR.
- **`build-gate.yml`** — compiles for `sm_90` (M1) and `sm_100` (M2), path-filtered.
  `sm_103` is deliberately absent: an arch the installed toolkit doesn't recognise breaks
  configure for every node.
- **`node-attestation.yml`** — labels `needs-node-run` on perf-bearing changes with no node
  attested. **Labels only; never closes a PR.**
- **`.gitattributes`** — pins source to LF. See the CRLF fix below for why.

### Changed

- **`sensitive-paths-guard`** retargeted. It guarded all of `bench/scripts/`, which is
  correct in sparkinfer (harness = scoring infrastructure, product = `runtime/`) but wrong
  here, where the harness **is** the deliverable — it would have gated every contribution
  the repo exists to receive. Narrowed to what actually determines a verdict:
  `reference.lock`, the `*.sha256` manifests, and `bench/results/`. `CODEOWNERS` matched.
- **`close-stale-prs`** rewritten. It **hardcoded `REPO: gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer`** —
  a scheduled job here would have tried to close pull requests in the *upstream* repo. It
  would have failed on permissions rather than succeeded, but that is not a failure mode to
  leave armed. Now uses `github.repository`, drops the RTX-5090 and eval-verdict steps
  (dead code without the SN74 bot), and moves 2 days → 14: a PR here can legitimately wait
  on node availability.
- **`copycat-guard`** now skips cleanly when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent. It passed on PR #1
  only because the author was a MEMBER; the first external PR would have failed on the
  missing secret.
- **PR template** retargeted from "Tested on RTX 5090" to the three milestone nodes, with
  the 1M capability probe and a pin-provenance checklist item.
- Tests 58 → 76.

### Removed

- `eval-policy.yml` (superseded by `ci.yml`), `rtx5090-required.yml` (wrong hardware, and
  auto-closed PRs on a criterion no PR here can satisfy), `build-attested-binaries.yml`
  (built `sm_120` Linux+Windows binaries and published release tarballs; this repo ships no
  binaries, and `sm_120` is not a node here).

### Fixed

- **`server/scripts/bench_api_vs_native.sh` was unrunnable.** Committed with CRLF, so its
  heredoc terminator was `PY\r`, which never matches `PY` — `bash` reported "unexpected end
  of file" and the script could not execute at all. Found within seconds of linting every
  script instead of four. Also fixed a second bug in the same file: the interpreter args sat
  on the line *after* the heredoc terminator, where the shell read them as a command to run
  and the Python saw an empty `argv` (so `sys.argv[1]` raised `IndexError`).
- CRLF normalised in five inherited source files under `server/`.
- `server/README.md` linked `../changelog-pro6000.md`, which has never existed in this tree.

## [Unreleased] — target retargeted to UD-Q2_K_XL @ 1M, four milestones

Repoints the whole repo at **UD-Q2_K_XL (802 GiB, 19 shards, 90.4% top-1)** at the full
**1,048,576**-token context, and structures the work as four milestones. Still no measured
numbers on any node.

Why Q2_K_XL and not IQ1_S: 90.4% top-1 against the lossless reference is the accuracy knee.
IQ1_S is 249 GiB smaller but drops to 78.9% — a 2% kernel win means little next to a
12-point quality gap in the weights being measured.

| | node | arch | total HBM | headroom @ 1M |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| **M1** | 8× H200 SXM | `sm_90` Hopper | 1128 GiB | 274 GiB |
| **M2** | 8× B200 SXM | `sm_100` Blackwell | 1440 GiB | 586 GiB |
| **M3** | 4×+ B300 | `sm_103` ⚠ unverified | 1152 GiB | 298 GiB |
| **M4** | vision (any node) | — | — | tower adds ~1 GiB |

M1–M3 change **only the node** — same quant, context and flags — so every delta is
attributable to hardware rather than a moving target. M4 is the one capability milestone.

### Added

- `bench/configs/b200_sxm.yaml`, `bench/configs/b300.yaml` — M2/M3 hardware profiles. B300
  carries `arch_verified: false`: `sm_103` is a guess, `detect_arch` wins at run time, and
  103 is deliberately **not** added to the CMake arch list because an arch the installed
  toolkit doesn't recognise breaks configure for every node, not just B300.
- `bench/configs/targets/kimi_k3_ud_q2kxl_{h200x8,b200x8,b300x4}.yaml` — one per hardware
  milestone, each with its exit criteria and the open questions it exists to answer.
- `bench/configs/targets/kimi_k3_vision_m4.yaml` — M4. Documents the four MoonViT-3d
  differences from the K2.5 tower (non-square fused QKV, RMSNorm, bias-free, post-norm
  projector), each a silent-wrong-output trap rather than a compile error.
- `--node h200x8|b200x8|b300x4` selects the `reference.lock` prefix and warns when the
  detected box doesn't match the claimed profile. Per-node prefixes matter *because* M1–M3
  are otherwise identical: one shared set of slots would conflate three GPU generations.
- `--longctx` probes 128k/256k/1M at 1 rep, recorded as `"kind": "probe"` not a median — a
  1M-token prefill is minutes of wall-clock per rep. Opt-in, but required to close a
  milestone; runs without it print a reminder.

### Changed

- **Default quant is now UD-Q2_K_XL.** Shard counts pinned for all six published quants
  (14/15/16/19/32/34) rather than discovered, so an interrupted download fails loudly.
- **The fit check prices context in.** `kimi_k3_headroom_gib` = KV at `KIMI_K3_MAX_CTX`
  (27 GiB at 1M) + compute buffers + state, replacing a flat 40 GiB. This is what lets it
  correctly reject UD-Q4_K_XL on 8× B200 at 1M while accepting it at 32k — and reject
  UD-IQ1_S on 4× H200 despite 553 < 564.
- `reference.lock` baselines are per-node (`KIMI_K3_H200X8_LLAMA_*` etc.) with `_1M` and
  `_1M_PP` slots added. All still `0` = not measured.
- Removed `bench/configs/targets/kimi_k3_ud_iq1s_h200x8.yaml` — two files each claiming to
  be "the target" is how a stale reference gets scored.
- Test suite 35 → 58: node profiles, every published quant's shard path, and the fit check
  at every node/quant/context combination.

### Fixed

- `ensure_model_split` accepts shard 1 under whatever `-of-NNNNN` it actually carries. The
  caller may have to guess the total before downloading, and a guessed total that didn't
  match reality read as a missing file — which would have failed every download for a quant
  whose shard count wasn't pinned.

## [Unreleased] — Kimi K3 evaluation baseline

Lands the **Kimi K3 evaluation baseline** on 8× H200. Baseline half only: sparkinfer has no
`kimi-k3` loader yet, so this branch adds nothing to the runtime and changes no existing verdict.
It exists so native K3 work is scored against a pinned, same-box, third-party-reproducible
reference instead of a claim. Details: [`docs/kimi-k3-baseline.md`](docs/kimi-k3-baseline.md).

### The baseline engine is a fork — necessarily

Kimi K3 has **896 routed experts**. Upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp` asserts
`n_expert <= LLAMA_MAX_EXPERTS` (512) and **cannot load the model at all**, so there is no
upstream number to compare against. The reference is `unslothai/llama.cpp` PR #48
(`kimi-k3-fullsize-vision`, `efc8bc38`) on top of `kimi-k3-text-base` (`cf67f0d2`), pinned as
`KIMI_K3_LLAMACPP_{REPO,REF,COMMIT,BASE_COMMIT}` in `bench/scripts/reference.lock`.

Load-bearing pieces of the fork: `LLAMA_MAX_EXPERTS 1024`; the `LLM_ARCH_KIMI_K3` graph
(hybrid KDA + MLA, `situ` activation, latent MoE, cross-layer attention residual, MLA output
gate, full-rank KDA gate); `graph_max_nodes = max(n_tokens*160, 64*n_tensors)` because the
shared `*40` budget dies at ubatch 3840; and PR #48 making `expert_latent_length`,
`attn_res.block_size` and both `situ` betas **required** KV keys rather than silent defaults.

### Added

- `bench/scripts/kimi_k3_baseline.sh` — builds the pinned fork for sm_90, verifies the 14-shard
  GGUF, sweeps `llama-bench` decode + prefill at 128/512/4k/32k, writes JSON to `bench/results/`.
  `--dry-run` prints the full plan with no network and no GPU.
- `bench/scripts/kimi_k3_reference_server.sh` — accuracy reference for `accuracy_compare.py`,
  with the two mandatory K3 flags: `--no-context-shift` (hybrid recurrent arch — llama.cpp
  can't context-shift or restore slots, so a long eval dies mid-run) and `--no-jinja` (the gate
  posts raw token ids; a chat template would prepend tokens the candidate never saw).
- `bench/scripts/_kimi_k3.sh` — quant/shard/flag definitions. Sourcing it is the single act
  that switches the baseline engine to the fork, so the Qwen evals keep the upstream pin and no
  fork commit can leak into their verdicts. Uses a separate `.llamacpp-k3` checkout so the two
  pins don't fight over one tree.
- `bench/configs/models/kimi_k3.yaml` — full arch spec, every field traced to
  `moonshotai/Kimi-K3/config.json` or the fork's `conversion/kimi_k3.py` / `src/models/kimi-k3.cpp`.
- `bench/configs/h200_sxm.yaml`, `bench/configs/targets/kimi_k3_ud_iq1s_h200x8.yaml`.
- `bench/scripts/test_kimi_k3_baseline.py` — 35 tests, no GPU or weights required.

### Changed

- `_common.sh`: `LLAMACPP_REF` lets the builder pin a fork/PR head (GitHub refuses fetch-by-sha
  there) and then **asserts** the ref resolves to `LLAMACPP_COMMIT` — a force-push fails the run
  instead of silently moving the baseline. Adds `LLAMACPP_EXTRA_TARGETS`, `gpu_count`,
  `gpu_vram_gib_total`, and `ensure_model_split` / `verify_model_split` for multi-shard weights.
- `gen_eval_prompt.py`: new `--gguf` backend tokenizes via `llama-tokenize` (opened `vocab_only`).
  K3 ships a tiktoken vocab, not `tokenizer.json`, so `Tokenizer.from_file` has nothing to load.
  The `tokenizer.json` path is untouched; `tokenizers` is now imported lazily.

### Guardrails, not conveniences

- `kimi_k3_check_fits` **refuses** to run when the weights + 40 GiB headroom exceed visible HBM.
  UD-IQ1_S is 553 GiB; a silently half-offloaded baseline is not reproducible and not accepted.
- Every measured slot ships **unset**: `KIMI_K3_LLAMA_*` are `0` in `reference.lock` and every
  sparkinfer slot in the target YAML is `null`. Downstream, a hand-filled baseline is
  indistinguishable from a measured one.

### Known limits

H200 is Hopper (`sm_90`); `kernels/` targets Blackwell `sm_120`/`sm_121`, so a source build
compiles but no sm_90 path is tuned. Hopper has no FP4 tensor core, so K3's MXFP4/1–2-bit expert
GEMMs dequantize before the MMA — llama.cpp takes the same path, so the comparison is fair, but
the ceiling is lower than on Blackwell. No vision baseline yet (`mmproj` and `llama-mtmd-cli` are
wired up, but there's no image benchmark). **No numbers measured** — the sweep has not been run.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-07-28

sparkinfer lands **DFlash block-diffusion speculative decode** for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B — the first
opt-in multi-token draft path on the native GGUF runtime. Greedy DFlash matches autoregressive
bit-for-bit (`SPEC_AGREE = 100%`). Default generate stays AR; set `SPARKINFER_DFLASH=1` with the
z-lab draft weights to enable it.

Alongside DFlash, the Qwen3.6 **prefill frontier climbs again** (README: **+127% vs llama.cpp at
32k**) and continuous-batching **mixed-load TTFT drops ~97%** on the decode-first CB path.

### ⚡ DFlash — the main story

Block-diffusion draft (`z-lab/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-DFlash` safetensors) + target UD-Q4_K_M GGUF on RTX 5090.

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Single-stream DFlash verify + draft KV (update-then-crop) |
| **Correctness** | Greedy **SPEC_AGREE 100%** vs AR (`qwen3_gguf_dflash_check` / `dflash_accuracy.sh`) |
| **Opt-in** | `SPARKINFER_DFLASH=1` when a draft is attached; AR path unchanged when unset |
| **Tools** | `qwen3_gguf_dflash_check`, `qwen3_gguf_dflash_bench`, `bench/scripts/dflash_accuracy.sh` |

CB/server multi-accept stays deferred until the single-stream path proves a tok/s win on top of
SPEC_AGREE (token-loop verify is the current correctness-first landing).

```bash
# Correctness gate (multi-seed SPEC + draft-KV canary)
bench/scripts/dflash_accuracy.sh /path/to/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B.gguf /path/to/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-DFlash

# Throughput + mean accept length τ
build/runtime/qwen3_gguf_dflash_bench target.gguf draft_dir 64 <token-ids...>
```

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-21

sparkinfer's **prefill stack is the headline of this release**: Qwythos (Qwen3.5) is now
**+183.6% faster than llama.cpp at 128k prefill**, and Qwen3.6 is **+82.7% faster at 32k prefill** —
both on the same RTX 5090 / pinned llama.cpp commit (`6f4f53f`). The live chat at
**[sparkinfer.com/chat](https://sparkinfer.com/chat)** now serves **Qwen3.6**.

### ⚡ Prefill — the main story

Dense + MoE prefill landed a chain of weight-amortized and int8 tensor-core wins since v0.4.2.
Long-context prompt processing is where agents feel latency first — this release closes that gap
past llama.cpp at the lengths that matter.

#### Qwythos (Qwen3.5-9B) · Q4_K_M · RTX 5090

| context | sparkinfer (pp tok/s) | llama.cpp (pp tok/s) | vs llama |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **4k prefill** | **~19,580** | 11,105 | **~+76%** |
| **32k prefill** | **~20,170** | 9,772 | **~+106%** |
| **64k prefill** | **~20,150** | 8,154 | **~+147%** |
| **128k prefill** | **~17,015** | 6,000 | **+183.6%** |

Headline: **128k prefill +183.6% vs llama.cpp** (17,015 vs 5,999.59 pp tok/s; #557).

#### Qwen3.6-35B-A3B · UD-Q4_K_M · RTX 5090

Expert-grouped int8 MoE prefill (#530 → #537 → #548 → #553) lifts long-prompt MoE far past the
v0.4.2 decode-focused frontier.

| context | sparkinfer (pp tok/s) | llama.cpp (pp tok/s) | vs llama |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **512 prefill** | **~3,510** | 8,737 | (short-N still climbing) |
| **4k prefill** | **~11,580** | 8,726 | **~+33%** |
| **16k prefill** | **~14,160** | 8,390 | **~+69%** |
| **32k prefill** | **~14,587** | 7,984 | **+82.7%** |

Headline: **32k prefill +82.7% vs llama.cpp** (14,587 vs 7,984 pp tok/s).

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-17

sparkinfer now **beats llama.cpp on Qwythos prefill at every tracked context** — climbing from **290 → 16,083 pp tok/s**
at 4k and reaching **2.18× llama.cpp at 64k** (17,772 vs 8,154 pp tok/s). The first public demo is live at
**[sparkinfer.com](https://sparkinfer.com/)** with an OpenAI-compatible API at **[api.sparkinfer.com](https://api.sparkinfer.com/)**.
Qwen3.6 decode frontier holds at **473 tok/s (+71%)**. GitHub-attested **Linux + Windows** bench binaries ship with this release.

### ⚡ Qwythos (Qwen3.5-9B) prefill — **2.18× llama.cpp at 64k**

Dense hybrid Gated-DeltaNet + full-attention · Q4_K_M · RTX 5090. Prefill measured with `qwen3_gguf_bench`

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-13

sparkinfer now leads **llama.cpp by 70%+ on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** — the project's primary **SOTA** open MoE —
while extending **long-context decode** through **128k** on Qwen3.5 (Qwythos) and holding verified gains on
Qwen3.6 through **32k**. Same RTX 5090, same UD-Q4_K_M / Q4_K_M GGUFs, Polaris-attested eval logs.

### 🏆 Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (SOTA) — **+71%** past llama.cpp at 128-token decode

Hybrid Gated-DeltaNet + full-attention MoE · 256 experts top-8 · hd256. Frontier climbed **425 → 473 tok/s**
since v0.4.0; every tracked context from 128 through 32k stays **50%+ ahead** of llama.cpp on the same box.

| context | sparkinfer | llama.cpp | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **128-token decode** | **473.3 tok/s** | 275.81 tok/s | **+71%** |

| **32k-context decode** | **427.6 tok/s** | 279.83 tok/s | **+53%** |

Top-1 **0.953**, KL **0.031** vs llama.cpp on held-out prompts.

### 📏 Long context — measured through 128k

KV cache cap raised to **128k context** (`kMaxBlocksPerSeq=10240`; 131,072 prompt tokens plus decode
headroom) so Qwen3.5 bidirectional eval now scores **128 / 4k / 32k / 64k / 128k** with no-regression
guards. Qwen3.6 keeps the **5-context** ladder (128 → 32k); Qwen3-MoE long-context baselines unchanged.

| model | longest tracked ctx | sparkinfer @ longest | llama.cpp | notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** | 32k | **427.6 tok/s** | 279.83 tok/s | **+53%** · primary SOTA target |
| **Qwen3.5-9B (Qwythos)** | 128k | **159.2 tok/s** | 220.58 tok/s | decode verified to 128k |
| **Qwen3-MoE (30B-A3B)** | 32k | **260.3 tok/s** | 192.62 tok/s | **+35%** |

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-11

This release adds **Qwen3.5-9B (Qwythos)** as a first-class target and locks in **three-model** decode:
**Qwen3-MoE**, **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B**, and **Qwen3.5-9B** — all beating llama.cpp on the same RTX 5090
box. Qwen3.5 landed in under a day and is already **20%+ faster than llama.cpp** at 128/512/4k context;
Qwen3.6 holds the **30%+ long-context lead** from v0.3.8 with no regression.

### 🆕 Qwen3.5 (Qwythos-9B) — +24% past llama.cpp in one day

Dense hybrid Gated-DeltaNet + full-attention · 9B · hd256 · Q4_K_M. Same RTX 5090, 128 generated tokens,
`qwen3_gguf_bench` (3-rep median):

| context | sparkinfer | llama.cpp | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **128-token decode** | **279.8 tok/s** | 224.91 tok/s | **+24%** |
| **512-context decode** | **277.9 tok/s** | 225.10 tok/s | **+23%** |
| **4k-context decode** | **270.1 tok/s** | 224.68 tok/s | **+20%** |

Landed in a single sprint: dense-hybrid loader, FFN down Q6→Q4 requant at load (#323), split-K + int8
graph capture (#324), GQA-4 shared-KV tiles (#326), and bidirectional eval against Qwen3.6 guards.
**`SPARKINFER_DOWN_REQUANT_Q4K` now defaults ON** (set `=0` to keep native Q6_K reads).

### 🏁 Three models — all ahead of llama.cpp (128-token decode)

| model | sparkinfer (128 tok/s) | llama.cpp | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Qwen3-MoE (30B-A3B)** | **480.7 tok/s** | 365.85 tok/s | **+31%** |
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** | **424.9 tok/s** | 275.81 tok/s | **+54%** |
| **Qwen3.5-9B (Qwythos)** | **279.8 tok/s** | 224.91 tok/s | **+24%** |

Qwen3.6 long-context ladder unchanged vs v0.3.8 (post-#300 MMA correctness rebench):

| context | sparkinfer | llama.cpp | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **128-token decode** | **424.9 tok/s** | 275.81 tok/s | **+54%** |
| **512-context decode** | **420.1 tok/s** | 275.61 tok/s | **+52%** |
| **4k-context decode** | **403.1 tok/s** | 276.30 tok/s | **+46%** |
| **16k-context decode** | **386.4 tok/s** | 280.66 tok/s | **+38%** |
| **32k-context decode** | **364.3 tok/s** | 279.83 tok/s | **+30%** |

### Performance — landed since v0.3.8

- **#318** (`eval:M`) — quantized dense FFN + GDN fusions + hd256 32k combine
- **#323** (`eval:S`) — requantize dense FFN down Q6_K→Q4_K at load (~5% Qwythos decode)
- **#324** (`eval:M`) — tune dense split-K and int8 graph capture for Qwen3.5
- **#326** (`eval:XS`) — GQA-4 shared-KV tile for Qwythos dense attention
- **#331** (`eval:XS`) — complete MoE gate_up→quant_h→down PDL chain for bs=1 decode
- **#300** — hd256 MMA correctness fix in flash-decode split (no perf regression on release rebench)

### Eval — Polaris Ed25519 fallback

When Intel TDX is unavailable (Polaris API timeout/404), the eval bot falls back to **Ed25519-signed
receipts** if `SPARKINFER_POLARIS_PRIVATE_KEY` is set — eval logs still ship a verifiable receipt.

### The proof, in four layers

1. **Speed** — three models, each **20–54%** over llama.cpp on the same GPU/GGUF; Qwen3.6 long-context lead held.
2. **Correctness** — top-1 **≥ 0.95**, KL **≈ 0.01** vs llama.cpp on held-out prompts.
3. **Same-box baseline** — bidirectional Qwen3.5 + Qwen3.6 eval with per-model no-regression guards.
4. **Polaris** — TDX receipts when available; Ed25519 fallback when the enclave API is down.

**Verified:** RTX 5090 · Qwen3.5 **280 tok/s** (128-tok) · Qwen3.6 **425 tok/s** (128-tok) · Qwen3-MoE **481 tok/s** (128-tok).

## [0.3.8] — 2026-07-09

This release adds **hardware-rooted trust** to the eval pipeline and locks in the Qwen3.6 speed story
across the full context ladder. Every graded run can now ship an **Intel TDX attestation** (Polaris) that
third parties verify offline — and Qwen3.6 stays **30%+ faster than llama.cpp at every tracked context,
128 through 32k**, on the same RTX 5090 and UD-Q4_K_M GGUF.

### 🔐 Polaris — verifiable eval receipts (Intel TDX)

The benchmark loop is no longer "trust us, we ran it on a GPU." The bot can emit a **Polaris receipt**
that binds code commit, model SHA256, eval seed, and measured tok/s to an **Intel DCAP quote**:

- **#295** — Polaris TDX integration: `judge.py` assembles attestations on the eval box; the bot submits
  scoring to Polaris and uploads signed receipts alongside eval logs
- **#301** — production fixes: correct API wiring, Qwen3.6 model SHA pinning, stdout forwarding so
  `POLARIS_ATTESTATION` survives SSH capture, TDX verify/hash fixes; smoke + test helper scripts

Anyone can run `eval/polaris/verify.py receipt.json` — no GPU, no trust in the operator.

### 🏁 Qwen3.6 — 30%+ past llama.cpp at every context

Same RTX 5090, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, 128 generated tokens, warm & interleaved vs `llama-bench`:

| context | sparkinfer | llama.cpp | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **128-token decode** | **426.0 tok/s** | 275.81 tok/s | **+54%** |
| **512-context decode** | **419.2 tok/s** | 275.61 tok/s | **+52%** |
| **4k-context decode** | **402.4 tok/s** | 276.30 tok/s | **+46%** |
| **16k-context decode** | **385.2 tok/s** | 280.66 tok/s | **+37%** |
| **32k-context decode** | **363.5 tok/s** | 279.83 tok/s | **+30%** |

The frontier climbed **23 → 426 tok/s** in under a week; the long-context tail no longer lags.

### Performance — landed since v0.3.7

- **#282** (`eval:XL`) — fused router GEMV + bitonic top-k (grid-completion decode) — **426 tok/s at 128-ctx** (@fansilas)
- **#279** — partial-RoPE KV fuse, GDN conv-L2, Q5 S=8, Q8_0 MMVQ, addnorm3 (@jimcody1995)
- **#284** — int8 KV + tensor-core flash-decode for the hd256 full-attn layers (@nickmopen)

### The proof, in four layers

v0.3.8 stacks proof the way v0.3.6 stacked speed + correctness + quality — now with **hardware attestation**:

1. **Speed** — Qwen3.6 +30–54% over llama.cpp at 128/512/4k/16k/32k on the same box/GGUF.
2. **Correctness** — top-1 **≥ 0.95**, KL **≈ 0.01** vs llama.cpp on held-out prompts.
3. **Same-box baseline** — every PR graded against origin/main measured in-session (no hardware lottery).
4. **Polaris TDX** — Intel-verified receipt per eval; offline verification without re-running the GPU job.

**Verified:** RTX 5090, Qwen3.6 **426 tok/s** (128-tok), top-1 **0.95**, Polaris `intel_verified=True`.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-07-04

This release breaks the long-context deficit wide open and adds a new axis of proof. sparkinfer now
beats the llama.cpp Q4_K_M baseline by **30–36% from 128 to 16k, and ~30% (+29.8%) at 32k** on the same RTX 5090
and GGUF — the 16k lead jumped from **+8.4% (v0.3.5) to +31%** — driven by moving long-context attention
onto the tensor cores. And it ships the first **LLM-quality benchmark suite**, so the frontier is proven
on real task capability, not only speed and token-agreement.

### Performance — ~30% or more past llama.cpp at every context, out to 32k

Same RTX 5090, same Qwen3-MoE Q4_K_M GGUF, 128 generated tokens, warm and **interleaved** (per-round
A/B so GPU-clock drift cancels):

| context | sparkinfer | llama.cpp | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **128-token decode** | **489.86 tok/s** | 363.15 tok/s | **+34.9%** |
| **512-context decode** | **471.09 tok/s** | 346.45 tok/s | **+36.0%** |
| **4k-context decode** | **393.49 tok/s** | 295.35 tok/s | **+33.2%** |
| **16k-context decode** | **327.31 tok/s** | 249.18 tok/s | **+31.4%** |
| **32k-context decode** | **260.30 tok/s** | 200.52 tok/s | **+29.8%** |

### Added — int8 tensor-core long-context flash decode (#195, #221)

The 16k/32k gains come from the first use of **tensor cores in the decode path**:

- **#195** (`eval:XL`) — a "gutted-dot" experiment showed long-context flash decode is **compute-bound**
  on the per-token QK dot + warp reduction, not bandwidth-bound. So it batches the 8 GQA q-heads of a
  kv-head as the M dimension: `S = Q·Kᵀ` and `O = P·V` become small **int8 `wmma` matmuls** (2× throughput,
  int32 accumulate), and K/V are stored **int8 (Q8-style)** to **halve the KV read**. Context-adaptive
  (engages only ≥8k) and template-specialized on a compile-time flag, so 128/512/4k stay **byte-identical**.
- **#221** (`eval:XL`) — trims the kernel's shared-memory round-trips and raises occupancy from 4 to 5
  resident blocks/SM (register + shared-memory limited).

Together they took **16k decode 266 → 330 tok/s**, correctness held (top-1 ≥ 0.94, KL ≤ 0.04).

### Added — LLM quality benchmark suite (#192)

Speed and token-agreement don't prove the model still *answers well*. [`bench/quality`](bench/quality)
scores five standard capabilities on **real data** — **IFEval, GSM8K, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, BFCL** — with
deterministic, stdlib-only scorers (constraint checks, final-answer extraction, unit-test `pass@1`,
tool-call matching). A spot-check of the current frontier: **GSM8K 100%, IFEval 78%**, overall ~69% on a
real-data subset. Because sparkinfer matches llama.cpp at **96% top-1 / KL 0.017**, these scores are at
**parity with llama.cpp by construction** — the suite proves the optimizations preserved *capability*,
not just the token distribution.

### The proof, in three layers

v0.3.6 is deliberately not "fast only." Each frontier claim now stands on three independent checks:

1. **Speed** — +31–36% over llama.cpp from 128 to 16k and +29.8% at 32k, warm & interleaved on the same GPU/GGUF.
2. **Correctness** — every kernel gated at **top-1 ≥ 0.90 / KL ≤ 0.20** vs llama.cpp (currently ~0.96 / ~0.02),
   reproducible from source and immutably logged.
3. **Quality** — real-task benchmarks (IFEval/GSM8K/MMLU-Pro/HumanEval/BFCL) confirm the model still
   solves the tasks, at parity with the reference.

### Momentum

v0.3.5 first pushed past llama.cpp across the tracked context ladder (16k barely, +8%). v0.3.6 turns that
into a **decisive ~30%+ lead at every length through 32k** and proves it holds on quality. The next frontier:
deeper 32k+ work, KV-cache quantization beyond attention, and running the full quality suite in the eval gate.

Thanks to everyone keeping the benchmark loop fast, public, correctness-gated — and now quality-gated.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-07-03

This release lands the long-context follow-through: sparkinfer now beats the llama.cpp Q4_K_M baseline
at every tracked dashboard context size — **128, 512, 4k, and 16k** — on the same RTX 5090 and same
GGUF. The headline is no longer only the short decode frontier; the 16k path is now ahead too.

![sparkinfer v0.3.5 all tracked contexts pass llama.cpp](docs/releases/v0.3.5.png)

### Performance — all tracked context sizes are past llama.cpp

Same RTX 5090, same Qwen3-MoE Q4_K_M GGUF, 128 generated tokens:

| context target | sparkinfer | llama.cpp | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **128-token decode** | **493.56 tok/s** | 365.85 tok/s | **+34.9%** |
| **512-context decode** | **469.58 tok/s** | 342.59 tok/s | **+37.1%** |
| **4k-context decode** | **392.65 tok/s** | 292.99 tok/s | **+34.0%** |
| **16k-context decode** | **266.14 tok/s** | 245.53 tok/s | **+8.4%** |

### Changed — the benchmark surface is now context-aware

The evaluation loop now treats **128, 512, 4k, and 16k** as first-class guard surfaces. A PR can earn
credit for improving any one context by at least 2%, without aggregating small gains across unrelated
contexts. Regressions are labeled by context (`regression-128`, `regression-512`, `regression-4k`,
`regression-16k`) so contributors can see exactly where a change helped or hurt.

The dashboard was updated to show the full context comparison directly against llama.cpp, including
both card summaries and paired horizontal bars. This keeps the public frontier easy to scan while the
project moves from short-decode wins into long-context competition.

### Momentum

v0.3.4 proved the first short-decode optimization round. v0.3.5 proves the next step: the same
optimization loop can push past llama.cpp across the visible context ladder, including 16k. The next
frontier remains deeper long-context work: 16k/32k stability, paged/KV read efficiency, KV staging, and
continued decode-kernel occupancy work.

Thanks to all contributors and reviewers keeping the benchmark loop fast, public, and competitive.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-07-02

This release closes the **first round of decode optimization** and marks it as a working proof of
concept: contributors can move the RTX 5090 Qwen3-MoE frontier quickly, the eval loop can verify it,
and the dashboard can carry the public proof trail. The headline 128-token frontier is now
**484.79 tok/s** on Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M — **32.5% faster than llama.cpp** on the same RTX 5090
128-token decode target — with top-1 **0.9612** and KL **0.0175** vs llama.cpp.

![sparkinfer v0.3.4 RTX 5090 decode frontier](docs/releases/v0.3.4.png)

### Performance — first decode-optimization round lands at 484.79 tok/s
The round merged the final short-context decode pass:
- **#121** — optimize Qwen decode kernels; evaluated at **468.10 tok/s** (`eval:none`) and merged as
  useful implementation groundwork.
- **#122** — fuse QK-norm + RoPE + KV append and emit Q8_1 attention data in the flash combine path;
  evaluated at **479.83 tok/s** (`eval:L`) and advanced the public frontier.

After merging, a final `origin/main` benchmark on the cached RTX 5090 measured **484.79 tok/s** at the
same 128-token decode target, versus llama.cpp at **365.85 tok/s**: **+32.5% faster than llama.cpp**.
This is the last optimization of the first short-decode round: enough to prove the path, not the end
of the project.

### Next — compete at long context
The published milestone remains the next focus: **16k and 32k context**. v0.3.3 showed the long-context
proof of concept; v0.3.4 finishes the short-decode momentum and points contributors at the next
competition surface: long-context flash decode, paged/KV read efficiency, KV quantization, and stable
eval dimensions for 16k/32k.

### Thanks
Thanks to everyone who contributed, evaluated, reviewed, and kept the loop moving with momentum.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-07-01

Two things this release: scoring that **rewards late-game effort** (so it stays worth optimizing as the
frontier matures), and a **long-context proof of concept** that finds — and largely fixes — the biggest
open opportunity, to point contributors at where the real headroom is. The 128-tok frontier is
unchanged at **453.70 tok/s**.

### Changed — difficulty-compensated scoring (#113): reward late-game effort
As the frontier pulls past llama.cpp, each further % gain gets much harder (near the roofline the
easy headroom is gone), so a fixed %-band scale under-rewards late-game work — a hard +4% now took
more than an easy +20% at cold start. `label.py` now scales the **label tier** by a difficulty
multiplier `D = 1 + K·max(0, frontier/ref − 1)` (K=8, ref = llama.cpp 365.85, capped at 4×): a gain
scores like the effort it took relative to a mature baseline. Safeguards: the boost multiplies the
**label only** — `pct_over_frontier` still reports the true measured speedup, the significance gate
stays on the **raw** delta (noise is never boosted), and the cold-start era (frontier ≤ ref) is
untouched (D=1, no retroactive inflation). Applied from new evals onward. On the real history #83/#89/#86
move S→M/L; everything below llama is unchanged. Governance-tunable (`SPARKINFER_DIFFICULTY_{BOOST,K,REF,MAX}`);
replay with [`eval/sim_difficulty.py`](eval/sim_difficulty.py).

### Added — long-context decode: the deficit found, and a first fix (#115) — proof of concept for miners
Our headline "+24% past llama.cpp" is measured at 128-tok; at real KV **depth** the story reverses.
A same-box depth sweep (sparkinfer vs `llama-bench -d`) found sparkinfer's decode **collapses** with
context — **5.2× behind llama at 32k** (37 vs 193 tok/s), running ~6× *below* the memory roofline. Root
cause: the flash-decode split count was **fixed** (`n_splits=32`), so at 32k each split streamed a
~1024-long serial online-softmax chunk on ≤1024 blocks (latency-bound, SMs idle).

**#115 makes `n_splits` depth-adaptive** (scale with `seq_len`, target ~256 KV/split, powers of two from
32, capped 256) so the grid fills the SMs at depth; the decode CUDA graph is re-captured only ~log₂
times per generation. **Correctness-preserving by construction** — the online-softmax combine is an
*exact* reduction, bit-identical for any split count (top-1/KL unchanged). Short context is untouched
(adaptive holds 32 below ~8k), so the frontier is unaffected. Tune via `SPARKINFER_SPLIT_CHUNK`; pin a
fixed value via `SPARKINFER_NSPLITS`.

**Long-context speedup — RTX 5090, decode tok/s at KV depth:**

| KV depth | before (fixed 32) | after (adaptive) | speedup | gap to llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128 | 442.8 | 442.7 | 1.00× | unchanged (no short-context regression) |
| 4,096 | 194.0 | 193.8 | 1.00× | unchanged |
| **16,384** | 70.8 | **166.2** | **2.35×** | 3.4× → **1.44×** behind |
| **32,768** | 38.5 | **110.7** | **2.88×** | 5.0× → **1.74×** behind |

This is a **proof of concept, not the finish line** — it's here to guide contributors: long-context
flash-decode (KV-split scaling, paged-KV read efficiency, KV quantization) is where the headroom is, and
one config fix already closed most of a 5× gap. The 128-tok eval doesn't measure it yet — a long-context
eval dimension is the natural next step.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-30

The lead over llama.cpp **doubles to ~24%**, and the evaluation that proves it is **substantially
hardened** — held-out prompts, reference quarantine, clock-recorded runs, an immutable frontier
ledger, and a corrected KL metric.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 410.85 → 453.70 tok/s (+10.4%); now **24% past llama.cpp**
Two verified kernel optimizations merged (top-1 0.97):
- **#89** — run the Q/K/V projections on **concurrent CUDA streams**, overlapping latency-bound bs=1 GEMVs → 435.41, byte-identical (@James-CUDA)
- **#86** — **single-pass MoE top-k** (one parallel rank-count vs 8 serial arg-max passes) + fused RoPE/KV-append → 453.70 (@fansilas)

Same RTX 5090, same Q4_K_M GGUF, warm & interleaved vs `llama-bench`:

| decode length | sparkinfer | llama.cpp |   | vs v0.3.1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **128 tok** | **453.70** | 365.85 | **+24.0%** | was +12.1% |
| **256 tok** | **443.53** | 364.90 | **+21.6%** | was +10.0% |
| **512 tok** | **425.23** | 361.64 | **+17.6%** | was +6.7% |

The lead grew at **every** length — the recent decode-path work cut the per-token overhead that used
to shrink the long-context lead.

### Added — trust-hardened evaluation pipeline (#102)
Closes the remaining gaming/poisoning vectors from the eval trust-model audit:
- **Held-out prompts (H1)** — each eval scores a fresh, unpredictable per-seed window of a diverse
  corpus, so a submission can't overfit a fixed prompt; the seed is logged for reproduction.
- **Reference quarantine (C2)** — the baseline weights (sha256-pinned) and llama.cpp (commit-pinned)
  are verified/rebuilt each run, so a tampered persisted copy can't skew a verdict.
- **Clock record (M1)** — the graphics clock each number was produced at is pinned where the box
  permits and **always recorded**, so the absolute tok/s is reproducible.
- **Immutable frontier ledger (H2)** — every frontier advance appends a GitHub-timestamped line
  `(date, PR, author, commit, Δ%, prev→new)` to the public eval-log; auditable line-by-line.
- **Provenance** (clock, seed, reference pins) is written into every verdict and immutable log.

### Fixed — the KL accuracy metric (honest, strict gate kept)
The held-out KL looked high (0.27 on hard text) — investigation found a **measurement artifact**: the
gate dumped only sparkinfer's top-20 and floored llama's tail, over-penalizing KL on flat
distributions. The fix dumps a deeper top-k so llama's mass is covered; the **true divergence is ~0.02**
(top-1 0.97). Proven honest — a sensitivity test reads KL 18 on a deliberately broken build, and a
12-prompt sweep holds KL 0.007–0.022. So the **strict `KL ≤ 0.20` gate is kept**: it holds on held-out
text because the measurement is correct, not because it was loosened.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **453.70 tok/s** (128-tok), top-1 **0.97** vs llama.cpp — **+24.0% @128 /
  +21.6% @256 / +17.6% @512** over a fully-built CUDA llama.cpp, same-box, warm, interleaved.

### Contributors
- **@James-CUDA** — #89 (concurrent Q/K/V CUDA streams)
- **@fansilas** — #86 (single-pass MoE top-k + fused RoPE/KV-append)

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-29

The lead over llama.cpp widens to **double digits — and now holds at every context length** — and the
evaluation becomes **publicly verifiable**: a hardware trust model plus an immutable, per-run public log.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 388.68 → 410.85 tok/s (+5.7%); now **10%+ past llama.cpp**
Two verified kernel optimizations merged (top-1 0.97, KL ≈ 0.14):
- **#72** — split-K the router projection GEMV for decode occupancy → 394.45 (@Dexterity104)
- **#83** — emit Q8_1 from the residual RMSNorm, dropping the per-layer activation quantize → 410.85 (@fansilas)

Same RTX 5090, same Q4_K_M GGUF, warm & interleaved vs `llama-bench`:

| decode length | sparkinfer | llama.cpp |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| **128 tok** | **410.2** | 366.0 | **+12.1%** |
| **256 tok** | **402.2** | 365.8 | **+10.0%** |
| **512 tok** | **386.6** | 362.5 | **+6.7%** |

sparkinfer is now **ahead at every length** — v0.3.0 was ~parity at 512; the recent decode-path work
(residual Q8_1, router split-K) lifted the long-context number too.

### Added — trustless, publicly-verifiable evaluation
- **[`EVAL-TRUST.md`](EVAL-TRUST.md)** — the eval trust model: **reproducible from source today**, the
  attested-eval roadmap (CPU-TEE scoring receipts → multi-validator consensus), and the honest boundary
  (a consumer RTX 5090 has **no GPU Confidential Computing**, so the speed number is trusted via
  **reproduction + consensus**, not a GPU enclave — by design, since we optimize the hardware people own).
- **[sparkinfer-log](https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer-log)** — every eval is now committed
  **immutably** to a public repo (raw `log.txt` + `result.json`, host IPs scrubbed) and rendered at a
  **unique, verifiable URL per run** (GitHub Pages). The dashboard links each verdict to its proof.

### Changed — accuracy gate tightened
- **KL hard-reject at 0.20** (preferred ≤ 0.15): a speedup that erodes parity with llama.cpp now
  `REJECT`s regardless of tok/s. In practice #83 first regressed KL to 0.21 → `REJECT`, the author
  reworked it to KL 0.14 → clean `S` → merged. The gate forced a better PR.

### Fixed — eval stability
- **Warm-up before the baseline**, **fresh same-box checkout** on reused boxes (`FETCH_HEAD`, not a
  stale `origin/main`), and a **baseline sanity guard** — so cold clocks and stale builds can't skew a
  verdict.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **410.85 tok/s** (128-tok), top-1 **0.97** vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14) —
  **+12.1% @128 / +10.0% @256 / +6.7% @512** over llama.cpp, same-box, warm, interleaved.

### Contributors
- **@fansilas** — #83 (emit Q8_1 from the residual RMSNorm)
- **@Dexterity104** — #72 (split-K router projection GEMV)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-28

The milestone release: sparkinfer's CUDA kernels **overtake llama.cpp** on Qwen3-MoE single-stream
decode — at the **kernel level**, same model, same Q4_K_M precision, same greedy `bs=1` decode. No
speculative decoding (EAGLE-3 / Medusa), no draft model, no flash-decoding accuracy trade — just
faster kernels. Plus the first **production-readiness** feature: a thermal-safe inference governor.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 313.14 → 388.68 tok/s (+24%)
Four verified kernel optimizations merged (top-1 0.95–0.98 vs llama.cpp, KL ≈ 0.145):
- **#71** — int8 dp4a MMVQ for the Q4_K MoE down projection → 333.75 (@Dexterity104)
- **#74** — split-K MMVQ down for M-tier decode occupancy → 339.59 (@jaso0n0818)
- **#76** — fuse per-head Q/K-norm + Q/K rope into single kernels → 371.27 (@James-CUDA)
- **#73** — skip the unused per-expert token-count pass in single-token decode → 388.68 (@Dexterity104)

### 🏁 First to beat llama.cpp — at the kernel level
Same RTX 5090, same Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M GGUF, head-to-head vs `llama-bench`, warm & controlled:

| decode length | sparkinfer | llama.cpp |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| **128 tok** | **388.7** | 372.0 | **+4.5%** |
| 256 tok | 381.5 | 371.7 | +2.6% |
| 512 tok | 367.3 | 368.6 | ~parity |

A **genuine kernel win** — identical weights, precision, and greedy single-stream decode; the
speedup lives in the CUDA kernels (fused quantized MoE FFN, int8 dp4a MMVQ across every decode GEMV,
split-K occupancy, fused attention norms), **not** in algorithmic shortcuts. The lead is largest at
short generations and narrows to parity at long context — the per-token attention/KV path is the
next frontier.

### Added — production-readiness: thermal-safe inference (#77, @ai-hpc)
- **`ThermalGovernor`** — a DVFS-style decode governor that throttles **throughput** when the GPU
  runs hot (turbo / balanced / safe / emergency tiers, predictive), **preserving correctness
  exactly**: it only paces token emission and never touches weights, precision, logits, or sampling,
  so output is **bit-identical** to an un-paced run. Opt-in; zero overhead when off. Forcing the
  tiers on a real RTX 5090 traded throughput for power **309 W → 87 W (3.5×)** with *identical token
  ids* across every mode.
- **GPU observability** — engine-level `query_gpu_stats()` / `Runtime::gpu_stats()` (heat, VRAM,
  power, SM clock via NVML, mapped to the CUDA device by PCI bus id).

### Changed — evaluation hardened against thermal & caching effects
- **Warm-up before the baseline.** The from-source build leaves the GPU idle for minutes, so the
  first timed build (the same-box baseline) was read on **cold clocks** and inflated every PR's
  delta. The bench now spins clocks to boost before timing.
- **Fresh same-box baseline on reused boxes.** The baseline checkout ran `git fetch origin origin/main`
  — which silently fails (the branch is `main`) — and on a **reused** box left a *stale* checkout, so
  it built **pre-merge** code and a just-merged gain was double-counted into the next PRs. Now it
  fetches the real branch and checks out `FETCH_HEAD` (guaranteed fresh).
- **Baseline sanity guard.** A run aborts if the same-box `main` baseline reads < 90 % of the known
  frontier (cold / throttling / degraded box) instead of grading against a bogus-low baseline.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **388.68 tok/s** (128-tok decode), top-1 **0.98** vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.145),
  **21.4 GB** resident — **+4.5 % over llama.cpp** at 128-tok, ~parity at 512-tok. Same-box, warm,
  llama-anchored, controlled measurement.

### Contributors
- **@Dexterity104** — #71 (int8 dp4a Q4_K MoE down), #73 (skip per-expert token count)
- **@jaso0n0818** — #74 (split-K MMVQ down)
- **@James-CUDA** — #76 (fuse Q/K-norm + Q/K rope)
- **@ai-hpc** — #77 (thermal governor + GPU observability)

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-26

A performance jump **and** a fairer, more trustworthy evaluation: every PR is now measured against
`main` on the **same GPU**, scored on the same-box delta, and worked through a per-round merge
workflow that can auto-merge the winner.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 285.32 → 313.14 tok/s (+9.7%)
Two verified MMVQ int8 quantized-read optimizations merged (top-1 0.99 vs llama.cpp, KL ≈ 0.15):
- **#65** — int8 dp4a MMVQ for the Q6_K MoE down projection → 291.58 (@bohdansolovie)
- **#70** — int8 MMVQ for the last fp32-path GEMVs (attn-V + LM head + gate/up) → 313.14 (@James-CUDA)

The llama.cpp gap closed to **0.86×** (313.14 vs 365.73 tok/s).

### Changed — fairer, hardware-independent scoring
- **Same-box baseline.** Each eval builds **current `main` and the PR on the same RTX 5090** and
  scores the **delta between them**, so speed differences between eval machines can't inflate or
  hide a result. (Previously a PR's tok/s was compared to a frontier measured on a *different* box.)
- **No within-run ratchet — independent PRs each score.** Every queued PR is graded against `main`,
  not against the other PRs in the run. Before, whichever PR was graded first ratcheted the frontier
  and made the next — a *different* optimization — look like `eval:none`.
- **Label tiers are now bands of % over the frontier** (`XS` 2–3.5% … `XL` >18%), so all five stay
  reachable as decode speed grows (the old fraction-of-headroom rule collapsed the small tiers).

### Added — per-round merge workflow (+ guarded auto-merge)
- A round grades the whole queue against the same `main`, labels the biggest verified speedup
  **`merge-first`** and the rest **`needs-rebase`**. After the winner merges, rivals **rebase onto
  the new `main`** and the bot re-evaluates them for their *marginal* gain on top — so independent
  wins stack and an overlapping one correctly drops to `none` (`re-evaluate` tags the re-grade).
- **Auto-merge (opt-in, heavily guarded).** The `merge-first` winner auto-merges only with a verified
  speedup, no `copycat`/`flagged:gaming`/`penalty`/`hold`, author in good standing, changes confined
  to `kernels`/`runtime`/`moe`, clean CI, and no conflicts. A `hold` label or `SPARKINFER_AUTOMERGE=0`
  stops it; branch protection is still enforced.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard journey is merged-only.** The frontier and the optimization journey advance only when a
  PR is **merged** (by its measured tok/s), not on eval — so unmerged or losing-rival evals no longer
  pollute the chart.
- **Self-healing eval box.** Stopped vast.ai boxes get reclaimed, so the pinned box can vanish between
  runs; the bot now reuses it if it survived, else provisions a fresh one (Google Drive model fetch)
  immediately and re-pins — no wasted retries.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **313.14 tok/s**, top-1 0.99 vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.15 nats), 21.4 GB resident.
  Auto-evaluation runs on a 2-hour schedule.

### Contributors
- **@James-CUDA** — #70 (int8 MMVQ for the fp32-path GEMVs)
- **@bohdansolovie** — #65 (int8 dp4a MMVQ for the Q6_K MoE down)

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-26

A day of rapid frontier progress (**+52% decode**), a copycat caught gaming the eval, and a
hardened auto-eval pipeline that now runs reliably on a 30-minute schedule.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 187.61 → 285.32 tok/s (+52%) in a day
Five verified speedups landed since v0.2.0, each paid only for its **marginal gain over the
previous frontier** (correctness-gated, top-1 ≥ 96% vs llama.cpp throughout):

| PR | optimization | → frontier | label |
|----|--------------|-----------:|:-----:|
| #44 | vectorized fused RMSNorm (128-bit bf16×8 loads) | 197.22 | `M` |
| #50 | decode dp4a (MMVQ) default + argmax widen | 240.11 | `XL` |
| #52 | two-pass multi-block decode argmax (1 SM → all SMs) | 262.17 | `L` |
| #59 | llama.cpp Q4_K `mul_mat_vec_q` for attention GEMVs | 279.11 | `L` |
| #63 | parallelized flash-decode combine + `n_splits=32` | 285.32 | `M` |

The llama.cpp gap closed to **0.78×** (285.32 vs 365.73 tok/s).

### Security (anti-gaming)
- **Copycat-to-bypass capture + 5-day penalty.** Caught a PR that re-submitted an earlier
  author's diff with a few extra lines bolted on to look original and slip past the eval — the
  diff-containment fingerprint flags these even with cosmetic additions. A first copycat strike
  now **freezes the author's evaluations for 5 days** (`penalty` label, skipped; already-scored
  PRs keep their result); a **2nd strike auto-blocks**. Logged in `.github/copycats.json` /
  `COPYCATS.md`.
- **No manual eval override.** Removed the `force-eval` bypass entirely — every PR is evaluated
  on a real RTX 5090 **only** after it legitimately passes the gate (box ticked **and** a real
  before<after decode table). Nothing skips the benchmark.

### Fixed — stabilized 30-minute auto-evaluation
- **Google Drive model source.** HuggingFace was throttling the 18.6 GB GGUF to ~0.2–5 KB/s on
  many vast.ai hosts (effectively stalled). The eval now fetches it from Google Drive via `gdown`
  (measured **20–74 MB/s**), with HF/curl as fallback — the model lands in minutes, not never.
- **Pinned stable instance (reuse-first, never destroy).** The eval reuses one known-good box
  with the cached model by default instead of provisioning fresh each run. On bring-up failure it
  retries on the next run (~30 min) up to twice before provisioning a new box — and **never
  destroys the pinned one**. Eliminates the re-download / re-provision churn between runs.
- **Dud-host skip-list + cron lock.** Blacklist hosts whose entire network is dead (not just HF);
  a `flock` lock prevents overlapping cron ticks. Together these make the 30-minute auto-eval reliable.
- **Dashboard.** Optimization-journey x-axis labels rotated 45° so the (now 12) bars no longer collide.

### Changed
- **Label tiers are now bands of % speedup over the frontier** (`XS` 2–3.5%, `S` 3.5–6%, `M` 6–10%,
  `L` 10–18%, `XL` >18%; <2% is within noise → `none`) — same denominator as the significance gate.
  The previous *fraction-of-headroom* rule collapsed `XS`/`S` once the frontier neared the ceiling
  (the 2% noise floor alone exceeded their headroom bands); the new bands keep all five tiers
  reachable and scale with decode speed.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **285.32 tok/s**, top-1 0.96 vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14 nats), 21.4 GB resident.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-25

Evaluation-pipeline hardening, anti-gaming controls, and the live frontier dashboard.

### Added
- **Opt-in RTX 5090 evaluation** — the PR auto-eval bot runs the on-device eval only after the
  PR template's *Tested on RTX 5090* box is ticked (auto-applies `test-on-5090`) or a maintainer
  greenlights it; otherwise the PR is labeled `not-tested` and skipped (no GPU). Falsely ticking
  the box is treated as gaming.
- **Live optimization-journey chart** on the [dashboard](https://gittensor-ai-lab.github.io/sparkinfer/dashboard/)
  — recorded passes (history) plus optimizations that have **landed** on the frontier; the bot
  appends each frontier-advancing merge automatically. Accuracy (token-match / KL) now tracks the
  frontier instead of a stale manual value.
- **Community safety hardening** (merged PRs) — input/scratch bounds guards across the MoE expert
  FFN, decode runner, and router kernel; GGUF load-time validation (reject unsupported GGML types,
  clamp invalid `general.alignment`, bounds-check tensor regions vs file size).

### Security (anti-gaming)
- **Sensitive-path merge gate** — `CODEOWNERS` + a `sensitive-paths-guard` status check + branch
  protection block any non-maintainer PR touching the eval/scoring/governance paths (`eval/`,
  `bench/scripts/`, `.gittensor/`, `dashboard/data.json`, `.github/`). The bot also grades with
  `bench/scripts` pinned to `origin/main`, so a PR cannot grade itself.
- **Contributor denylist + auto-block** — `.github/blocked-contributors.txt` (+ `FLAGGED.md`
  evidence log); the bot flags, comments, closes, and skips eval for any PR whose opener or commit
  author/committer is blocked. First entry: a 2-account sybil pair sharing one git identity.
- **Copycat detection** — diff-fingerprint each PR against earlier ones; ≥80% containment of a
  *different* author's earlier diff → `copycat` label, skipped eval, logged to `.github/copycats.json`;
  2 strikes auto-blocks the author.

### Changed
- PRs are evaluated **oldest-first**, so the original of any duplicate is graded before its copy.
- Dashboard: removed the obsolete **emission-weights** panel (scoring is speedup-only — there is no
  per-subsystem budget).

### Fixed (evaluation pipeline)
- Provisioning self-heals: abandon phantom-`running` hosts in ~2 min, retry across hosts, blacklist
  repeat offenders, and survive SSH drops during the 17 GB model download (nohup + resumable fetch).
- Build: pin `g++-12` as the CUDA host compiler (nvcc vs Ubuntu 24.04 GCC 13.3 `cstdio` break);
  cap `-j2` to avoid OOM on 64 GB eval boxes.
- A submission that does not compile now yields a clean `eval:REJECT` instead of an infra error.
- **Force-clean per-PR checkout** — each PR builds its own commit (a stale-checkout bug had graded
  several PRs against the wrong code).
- Labels/comments applied via the GitHub REST API (the GraphQL path silently failed on a
  deprecation warning).

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier ratcheted to **187.61 tok/s** (PDL decode; #8, `eval:L`), **top-1 98%**
  token agreement vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14 nats).

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-22

First release of the consolidated **sparkinfer** monorepo (kernels + MoE engine + runtime + benchmarks).

### Added
- **Native GGUF loading** — mmap parser + on-GPU **byte-exact Q4_K / Q6_K dequant**;
  expert weights kept quantized resident (Q4_K_M-sized footprint, not bf16).
- **Qwen3-MoE runtime** — embed → RMSNorm → QKV → per-head QK-norm → RoPE → paged GQA
  flash-decode → routed top-k MoE (+ optional shared expert) → LM head → greedy decode.
- **Kernels** — flash-decode (hd128/256/512), **flash-decoding (KV-split)** attention,
  **fused quantized MoE expert FFN** (dequant only the routed experts on-read), decode
  GEMV (coalesced `[out,in]`), GEMM, fused RMSNorm, RoPE.
- **CUDA-graph decode** — the per-token compute is captured once and replayed.
- **Turnkey harness** — `bench/scripts/bench.sh` (decode tok/s, `--compare` vs llama.cpp)
  and `accuracy.sh` (token-match / KL / perplexity); auto-detect arch, fetch model.
- **Accuracy gate** — `qwen3_gguf_score` teacher-forced scorer (per-position argmax +
  top-k logprobs + perplexity), for regression-checking optimizations.
- **Prebuilt binaries** attached to this release (sm_120 / CUDA 13 / glibc 2.39), with
  automatic **source-build fallback** when incompatible.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** (sm_120, CUDA 13): `ctest` 5/5, compute-sanitizer 0 errors,
  **163.88 tok/s** decode, **100% top-1 token agreement** with llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14 nats),
  21.4 GB resident.
- **RTX PRO 6000** (sm_120, CUDA 12.8): **0.60 → 134 tok/s** decode across 6 source-verifiable
  optimization passes.

### Fixed (during RTX 5090 / CUDA 13 bring-up)
- CUDA 13 removed `cudaDeviceProp::memoryClockRate` / `memoryBusWidth` → query via
  `cudaDeviceGetAttribute` (portable across CUDA 12.x / 13).
- Flash-decode scratch (`fa_*`) was NULL on the non-GGUF path (allocated only in
  `load_gguf`) → moved to the constructor (caught by compute-sanitizer).
- Top-level superbuild was missing `enable_testing()` → `ctest` found no tests.
